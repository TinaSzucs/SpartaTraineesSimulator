# Sparta Trainees Simulator

This program simulates people training in different types of courses in training centres.

Between 0-50 new trainees need to be trained each month in different courses (Java, C#, etc...) and a random number of new training centres are created each month that they can train in.

# Instructions

After you start the program you can input a time in months to run the simulation and if you want to only view the end of the simulation or what happens each month.
