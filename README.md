# Sparta Trainees Simulator

This program simulates people training in different types of courses in training centres.

Between 50-100 new trainees need to be trained each month in different courses (Java, C#, etc...) and a random number and type of new training centres are created each 2 months that they can train in. The types of training centres are:
- Training Hubs train up to 100 trainees and 1-3 are opened if this is selected.
- Bootcamps train up to 500 trainees and stay open for 3 months if there are less than 25 trainees in them. Only 2 bootcamps can exist at the same time.
- Tech Centres train up to 200 trainees but only teaches one course (Java, C#, etc...).

Training centres are closed if their attendence is low and the trainees in them put at the front of the waiting list. After a year clients are generated to take away some trainees and will come back happy if their requirement next year or leave unhappy if it is not.
